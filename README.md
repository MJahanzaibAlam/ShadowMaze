# ShadowMaze
C# with XNA Game Project

Game classes are located in the <a href="https://github.com/MJahanzaibAlam/ShadowMaze/tree/master/ShadowMaze/ShadowMaze">main folder</a>.
<p>They are split into multiple folders: GamePlay, MapRelated, Screens, Other.</p>

<p>To try playing the game, download ShadowMaze.zip from the root directory, extract it, and run ShadowMaze.exe (note: this creates a folder in your documents folder for storing maps).</p>
